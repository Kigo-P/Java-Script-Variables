//Declare a variable y and initialize it with the value 5.

let y = 5;
console.log(y);

//Declare a variable sum and assign it the result of adding x and y.

let sum = x + y;
console.log(sum);

//Declare a variable product and assign it the result of multiplying x and y.

let product = x * y;
console.log(product);

//Declare a variable difference and assign it the result of subtracting y from x.

let difference = x - y;
console.log(difference);

//Declare a variable quotient and assign it the result of dividing x by y.

let quotient = x/y;
console.log(quotient);

//Get the remainder between x and y;

let remainder  = x%y;
console.log(remainder);

//Part 3: Working with Strings
//Declare a variable greeting and assign it a string that says "Hello, my name is " followed by your name.

let greeting = "Hello, my name is " + name;
console.log(greeting);

//Declare a variable fullGreeting and use template literals to create a string that includes your name and age.
